  Abstract                 = {The comparison of world music cultures has been a recurring topic in the field of musicology since the end of the nineteenth century. Recent advances in technology in the field of Music Information Retrieval allow for a large-scale analysis of music corpora. We review manual and computational approaches in the literature that fall within the scope of music corpus research and world music analysis. With a large-scale computational music corpus analysis in mind, we compare the tools and research questions addressed by each study and discuss strengths and weaknesses. Taking into account critical remarks from experts in the field and challenges involved in a large-scale computational analysis, we discuss how this line of research can be improved in future work.},

  Abstract                 = {Public evaluation campaigns and datasets promote active development in target research areas, allowing direct comparison of algorithms. The second edition of the challenge on detection and classification of acoustic scenes and events (DCASE 2016) has offered such an opportunity for development of the state-of-the-art methods, and succeeded in drawing together a large number of participants from academic and industrial backgrounds. In this paper, we report on the tasks and outcomes of the DCASE 2016 challenge. The challenge comprised four tasks: acoustic scene classification, sound event detection in synthetic audio, sound event detection in real-life audio, and domestic audio tagging. We present each task in detail and analyze the submitted systems in terms of design and performance. We observe the emergence of deep learning as the most popular classification method, replacing the traditional approaches based on Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. By contrast, feature representations have not changed substantially throughout the years, as mel frequency-based representations predominate in all tasks. The datasets created for and used in DCASE 2016 are publicly available and are a valuable resource for further research.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep neural networks (DNN) have been successfully applied to music classification including music tagging. However, there are several open questions regarding the training, evaluation, and analysis of DNNs. In this article, we investigate specific aspects of neural networks, the effects of noisy labels, to deepen our understanding of their properties. We analyse and (re-)validate a large music tagging dataset to investigate the reliability of training and evaluation. Using a trained network, we compute label vector similarities which is compared to groundtruth similarity. The results highlight several important aspects of music tagging and neural networks. We show that networks can be effective despite relatively large error rates in groundtruth datasets, while conjecturing that label noise can be the cause of varying tag-wise performance differences. Lastly, the analysis of our trained network provides valuable insight into the relationships between music tags. These results highlight the benefit of using data-driven methods to address automatic music tagging.},
